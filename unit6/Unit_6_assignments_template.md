### Martian Headsets.

It all starts with just one util function that does one thing. We don't take out the util function just because we want to design a good API, but just because we want to avoid duplication at all cost. Soon, the util function gets used by some other people in our organization. Soon, they just want to add some other stuffs, but then they can't add this other stuffs because other people depending on that stuffs, some people also depending on an undocumented (but observable) behavior. Every change breaks someone's workflow.

### Why are the Microsoft API Formats So Complicated.

If they had started with even just a design, they would at least have the spec written somewhere. By just dumping whatever contents in memory, it indicates that there's no spec and it will change every time there is a code change.

### How Microsoft Lost the API War.

Because Sim City relies on an undocumented part of DOS, and now Windows, didn't want to lose its market share so bad because it needed to have all applications running at all cost, was forced to conform to DOS specification of freeing memory (or at least, when the Sim City is running).

### What is Overengineering.

The word file format was under-engineered because it had no format at all other than a memory dump.

### Ways to Create Complexity: Break You API.

Data model design.

### Simplicity and Strictness.

The DOS was not that strict in its memory management, because it apparently still kept around the supposed to be deleted object.
